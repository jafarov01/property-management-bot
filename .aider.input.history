+Apply the changes accordingly to below analysis: Of course. Here is a detailed analysis and the recommended resolution fixes for the issues you've pointed out.
+
+### Feature 1: Email Notification via Telegram
+
+You're right to flag the polling interval as a source of delay. A five-minute wait is too long for urgent email notifications. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the issues and how to fix them.
+
+-----
+
+#### ‚ùå **Issue 1: High Polling Interval**
+
+The primary cause of the delay is the fixed 5-minute polling interval in the scheduler.
+
+  * **Root Cause:** The application uses a scheduled task to check for emails every five minutes, rather than a real-time trigger.
+  * **Impact:** Critical email notifications can be delayed by up to five minutes.
+
+##### **üîß Resolution**
+
+The quickest and simplest fix is to significantly reduce the polling interval. While a webhook-based approach like using the Gmail Push API would be the ideal solution for true real-time speed, lowering the interval to 30 seconds offers a substantial improvement without requiring a major architectural change.
+
+**In `app/main.py`, modify the scheduler job:**
+
+```python
+# In app/main.py
+
+# FROM:
+scheduler.add_job(check_emails_task, 'interval', minutes=5, id="email_checker", replace_existing=True)
+
+# TO:
+scheduler.add_job(check_emails_task, 'interval', seconds=30, id="email_checker", replace_existing=True)
+```
+
+-----
+
+#### ‚ùå **Issue 2: Blocking AI Processing**
+
+Your analysis correctly identifies that the sequential processing of emails can create a bottleneck. If the AI model is slow to respond for one email, it delays all subsequent emails in the queue.
+
+  * **Root Cause:** The `for` loop in `check_emails_task` processes emails one by one, waiting for the AI parsing of each email to complete before starting the next.
+  * **Impact:** A single slow AI response can delay the entire batch of new emails.
+
+##### **üîß Resolution**
+
+To resolve this, we can process each email in a separate, non-blocking background task. This allows the system to fire off all the AI parsing requests concurrently, preventing one slow email from holding up the others.
+
+**In `app/scheduled_tasks.py`, refactor `check_emails_task`:**
+
+```python
+# In app/scheduled_tasks.py
+
+import asyncio # Add this import at the top
+
+# This new async function will process a single email.
+@db_session_manager
+async def process_single_email(email_data: dict, bot: Bot, *, db: Session):
+    """Parses, notifies, and records a single email in a background task."""
+    try:
+        parsed_data = await email_parser.parse_booking_email_with_ai(
+            email_data["body"]
+        )
+
+        if parsed_data and parsed_data.get("category") not in [
+            "Parsing Failed",
+            "Parsing Exception",
+        ]:
+            # ... (The logic to create an EmailAlert and send a Telegram notification remains the same)
+            # This part of the code from the original check_emails_task can be moved here.
+            new_alert = models.EmailAlert(
+                category=parsed_data.get("category", "Uncategorized"),
+                summary=parsed_data.get("summary"),
+                guest_name=parsed_data.get("guest_name"),
+                property_code=parsed_data.get("property_code"),
+                platform=parsed_data.get("platform"),
+                reservation_number=parsed_data.get("reservation_number"),
+                deadline=parsed_data.get("deadline"),
+            )
+            db.add(new_alert)
+            db.commit()
+
+            notification_text, reply_markup = (
+                telegram_client.format_email_notification(new_alert)
+            )
+            sent_message = await telegram_client.send_telegram_message(
+                bot,
+                notification_text,
+                topic_name="EMAILS",
+                reply_markup=reply_markup,
+            )
+
+            if sent_message:
+                new_alert.telegram_message_id = sent_message.message_id
+                db.commit()
+        else:
+            # ... (The logic for handling parsing failures remains the same)
+            # This part of the code can also be moved here.
+            logging.warning(
+                f"AI parsing failed. Reason: {parsed_data.get('summary')}"
+            )
+            failure_summary = parsed_data.get(
+                "summary", "No summary provided by parser."
+            )
+            # ... etc.
+
+    except Exception as e:
+        logging.error(f"Failed to process a single email.", exc_info=e)
+        db.rollback()
+
+
+@db_session_manager
+async def check_emails_task(*, db: Session):
+    """Periodically fetches unread emails and processes them concurrently."""
+    logging.info("Running email check...")
+    try:
+        # fetch_unread_emails now needs to also return the IMAP message number
+        unread_emails = email_parser.fetch_unread_emails()
+        if not unread_emails:
+            return
+
+        logging.info(f"Found {len(unread_emails)} new emails to process.")
+        bot = Bot(token=config.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN)
+
+        # Create a concurrent task for each email
+        for email_data in unread_emails:
+            asyncio.create_task(process_single_email(email_data, bot))
+
+    except Exception as e:
+        logging.error(f"Critical error in check_emails_task.", exc_info=e)
+```

+
+### Feature 2: Overbooking / Relocation Logic
+
+Your analysis correctly identifies the potential for overbooking if the system doesn't validate property status before creating a booking. However, upon reviewing the provided `slack_handler.py` file, the logic to prevent this is already correctly implemented.
+
+The assumption that `slack_handler.py` was missing was incorrect, and the booking creation logic is more robust than what is suggested by looking at `slack_parser.py` alone.
+
+#### ‚úÖ **Existing Implementation is Correct**
+
+The file `slack_handler.py` already contains the necessary logic to check a property's status before creating a booking. It correctly handles the overbooking scenario.
+
+  * **Location:** The logic is within the `process_slack_message` function in `app/slack_handler.py`.
+  * **Process:**
+    1.  It receives a new check-in request from Slack.
+    2.  It queries the database to get the current status of the requested property.
+    3.  **If the property is `AVAILABLE`**, it changes the status to `OCCUPIED` and creates an `Active` booking.
+    4.  **If the property is already `OCCUPIED`**, it correctly identifies this as a conflict. It creates a *new* booking with the status `PENDING_RELOCATION` and sends an interactive alert to Telegram.
+    5.  **If the property is under `MAINTENANCE` or `PENDING_CLEANING`**, it also creates a booking with status `PENDING_RELOCATION` and sends a "Check-in Failed" alert.
+
+Here is the relevant code from **`app/slack_handler.py`** that demonstrates the existing, correct logic:
+
+```python
+# In app/slack_handler.py
+
+# ... inside process_slack_message ...
+
+prop = (
+    db.query(models.Property)
+    .filter(models.Property.code == prop_code)
+    .with_for_update()
+    .first()
+)
+
+# This is the crucial check.
+if prop.status != "AVAILABLE":
+    # Handles Overbooking on an already OCCUPIED room
+    if prop.status == "OCCUPIED":
+        # ... (logic to get the first booking) ...
+        booking_data["status"] = "PENDING_RELOCATION" # <-- Key logic
+        second_booking = models.Booking(
+            **booking_data, property_id=prop.id
+        )
+        db.add(second_booking)
+        db.commit()
+        # Sends the interactive conflict alert to Telegram
+        alert_text, reply_markup = (
+            telegram_client.format_conflict_alert(
+                prop.code, first_booking, second_booking
+            )
+        )
+        await telegram_client.send_telegram_message(
+            bot,
+            alert_text,
+            topic_name="ISSUES",
+            reply_markup=reply_markup,
+        )
+    # Handles check-in attempts on rooms that are not ready
+    else: # (i.e., status is PENDING_CLEANING or MAINTENANCE)
+        booking_data["status"] = "PENDING_RELOCATION" # <-- Key logic
+        failed_booking = models.Booking(
+            **booking_data, property_id=prop.id
+        )
+        # ... (logic to format and send the check-in error alert)
+    continue # Skips to the next booking in the list
+
+# This code only runs if the property was AVAILABLE
+prop.status = "OCCUPIED"
+db_booking = models.Booking(property_id=prop.id, **booking_data)
+db.add(db_booking)
+# ...
+```
+
+**Conclusion:** The overbooking detection and relocation logic is already implemented correctly in the system. The issue you pointed out in `slack_parser.py` is mitigated by the robust validation that occurs in `slack_handler.py`. No fix is required for this feature.
